\section{Key Terms You Should Know}\label{key-terms-you-should-know}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Alpha-level (\(\alpha\))}: probability of making a Type I error;
that is, rejecting the null hypothesis when it is in fact true (e.g., a
test indicates that a man is pregnant)
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Alternative Hypothesis} (\(H_A\) or \(H_1\)): the prediction
that there will be an effect.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Critical Value(s)}: the value of a given test statistic that
corresponds to a rejection point- the point at which you determine to
reject the null hypothesis. The critical value defines the boundary of
the rejection region for \(H_0\). This value depends on the significance
level, \(\alpha\), and whether the test is one-sided or two-sided.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Null Hypothesis} (\(H_0\)): the reverse of the alternative
hypothesis that your prediction is wrong and the predicted effect does
not exist.
\end{quote}

    Looking at the actual data, how does the sample standard deviation
    compare to that of the population?

For the last set of questions, suppose you have four children in a
reading group (Beth, Marianne, Steven, Joel) and you randomly pick one
child to lead the discussion in group each day of a 5-day week.
Furthermore, we define the outcome of each day's selection to be binary:
Steven leads the discussion or he doesn't.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{22}
\item
  The number of times Steven leads the discussion in a week would be
  the:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    probability distribution for this experiment
  \item
    probability of an outcome
  \item
    constant in this experiment
  \item
    random variable in this experiment
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  The probability that Steven leads the discussion all 5 days in a week
  is the:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    expected value
  \item
    probability distribution
  \item
    probability of a simple event
  \item
    random variable
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  If we could replicate this experiment many, many times, the average
  number of times that Steven leads the discussion in a week would be
  the:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    expected value
  \item
    probability distribution
  \item
    probability of an outcome
  \item
    random variable
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  If we found the probability of Steven leading the discussion zero
  times, one time, two times, three times, four times, and five times,
  the set of six probabilities would be the:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    expected value
  \item
    probability distribution
  \item
    probability of an outcome
  \item
    random variable
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Monday's selection of a discussion leader could be considered a
  \_\_\_\_, while the selections of discussion leaders for the week
  constitute a \_\_\_\_:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    binomial experiment, bernoulli trial
  \item
    bernoulli trial, binomial experiment
  \item
    neither
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  What is the probability that Steven would be selected all 5 days of
  the week?

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    .00000000000000
  \item
    .0009765625
  \item
    .0039065500
  \item
    .25
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  What is the expected number of times that Steven would be selected?

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    0.00
  \item
    1.00
  \item
    1.25
  \item
    2.50
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

  Using the following code, run a permutation test with the hypothesis
  that mean Hotwing consumption is different for men than for women
  (assume \(\alpha = .05\), 2-tailed). Does the data support your
  hypothesis, and what is the associated p-value?

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    The data supports \(H_A\), p = 0.00078
  \item
    The data supports \(H_A\), p = 0.00156
  \item
    We fail to reject \(H_0\), p = 0.156
  \item
    We fail to reject \(H_0\), p = 0.780
  \end{enumerate}
