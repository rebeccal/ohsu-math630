#Key Terms You Should Know
> __Alpha-level ($\alpha$)__: probability of making a Type I error; that is, rejecting the null hypothesis when it is in fact true (e.g., a test indicates that a man is pregnant)

> __Alternative Hypothesis__ ($H_A$ or $H_1$): the prediction that there will be an effect.

> __Critical Value(s)__: the value of a given test statistic that corresponds to a rejection point- the point at which you determine to reject the null hypothesis. The critical value defines the boundary of the rejection region for $H_0$. This value depends on the significance level, $\alpha$, and whether the test is one-sided or two-sided.

> __Null Hypothesis__ ($H_0$): the reverse of the alternative hypothesis that your prediction is wrong and the predicted effect does not exist.

#Free Answer Questions
1. Given the probability density function (below) of the random variable $X$:

    a. find $c$
    b. find the cumulative distribution function $F(x)$.
    c. Compute $P(1 <  X < 3)$

$$f(x) = \begin{cases} 
  cx, & 0 < x < 4 \\
  0, & \textrm{otherwise}
  \end{cases}$$
  


```{asis, echo=params$key}
<b>Answers</b>

a) 
\[
\begin{aligned}
\int_{0}^{4} cx dx &= 1 \\
  8c &= 1 \\
  c &= \frac{1}{8}
\end{aligned}
\]

b) 
As $\int \frac{1}{8} x dx$ is $\frac{x^{2}}{16}$,

| $x$   |   $F(X)$   |
|-------|------------|
| $x<0$ |  0         |
| $0 \leq x \leq 4$ | $\frac{x^{2}}{16}$ |
| $x>4$ | 1 |


c) 
\[
\begin{aligned}
P(1 < x < 3) &= F(3) - F(1) \\
  &= \frac{9}{16} - \frac{1}{16} \\
  &= \frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}

3. A researcher believes that in recent years women have been getting taller. She knows that 10 years ago the average height of young adult women living in her city was 63 inches ($\sigma = 3$). She randomly samples eight young adult women currently residing in her city and measures their heights. The following data are obtained (Height, in inches): 64, 66, 68, 60, 62, 65, 66, 63
  
    a. What is the alternative hypothesis? (In evaluating this experiment, assume a non-directional hypothesis is appropriate because there are insufficient theoretical and empirical bases to warrant a directional hypothesis.)
    b. What is the null hypothesis?
    c. Using the generic test statistic formula given in class ($\frac{\hat{\theta}-{\theta_0}}{SE_{\theta_0}}$), what is the appropriate numerator?
    d. Using the generic test statistic formula given in class ($\frac{\hat{\theta}-{\theta_0}}{SE_{\theta_0}}$), what is the appropriate denominator?
    e. Using $\alpha = 0.01$, what is/are the critical value(s) of the test statistic?
    f. Using $\alpha = 0.01$, what is the conclusion? (i.e. do we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis, and why?)
    g. Looking at the actual data, how does the sample standard deviation compare to that of the population?
    
```{asis, echo=params$key}
<b>Answers</b>

a) In recent years the height of women has been changing. 
Therefore the sample with $\bar{X_{obt}} = 64.25$ 
is not a random sample from a population where $\mu \neq 63$

b) It is reasonable to consider the sample with 
$\bar{X_{obt}} = 64.25$ is a random sample from a population 
where $\mu = 63$

c) single sample t-test on means

d) S = 2.550, $t_{obt}$ = 1.39

e) df = n-1 = 7, $t_{crit} = \pm 3.499$

f) since | $t_{obt}$ | < | $t_{crit}$ | , we retain the null hypothesis.

g) (61.1, 67.4)
