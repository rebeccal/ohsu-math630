#  Why did I burden you with all this information? 

+ Our regression coefficients, divided by their standard errors, are **also** distributed as t variables
+ Degrees of freedom: *n* ? 2 (in simple linear regression, because we have to account for the 2 coefficients we estimated from the sample data: the intercept + the slope)
+ We typically call the quantile our t crit .
+ In our example, the t crit  quantile is ( df = n ? 2 = 926):

**>** **qt** **(.975,** **df** **= n - 2** **) # + or -**

**[1] 1.962529**

#  Is the slope different from zero? 

+ What is ? 1 under the null hypothesis?

#  What is the 95% confidence interval? 

+ Mainly of interest for slope, not so much intercept
+ i.e., <U+0001D770> = .05:
+ **qt** **(.975,** **df** **= n - 2)**
