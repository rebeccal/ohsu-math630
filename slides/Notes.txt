Notes for next time...

Look at the plots in ncp_plus.Rmd

CM042 was way too short. Perhaps lecture longer/more on classic methods? (see below)

The slides for 2017 Class 12 should be better incorporated into CM 4.2 or 4.4 - In general, confidence intervals deserve more attention in a cohesive manner.

CM044 was almost too long. And definitely would be with the new CI/RoR slides. perhaps focus it more on NHST (z and t) and do CIs separately?

CM045 - need to add readings - use the ones from the reference page.

CM046 - Now doing a & b. a) GLM and t-tests. b) Anova
  There were some good slides on ncp that "could" be incorporated into cm045, however, one is ppt and one Rmd. I've saved the Rmd as ncp_plus.Rmd.
