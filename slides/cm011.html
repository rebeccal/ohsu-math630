# Math 530/630: CM 1.1
## Sample Data and Some Intuitive Statistics

---



# First - A little history
???
Design of Experiments - basis for future stats academic programs, introduced the null hypothesis!

R- 
- based on S, a functional language
- in 2011 it was rough
- Tidyverse makes it possible to easily teach data science/stats as well as R
- OHSU fully supports R

- Has changed the nature of this class
  - You need to be aware of all these options
  - Focus on concepts and practical application
  - No so "mathy", much more programmy

--
  
- Classical Statistics, as used today, is not that old
  - The first University Statistics program was started in 1911 by Karl Pearson
  - [_The Design of Experiments_ - Ronald Fisher, 1935](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Experiments)

--

- The practice of "statistics" is changing quickly 
  - by hand (using look-up tables)
  - computer software (Minitab, SPSS, SAS, Stata, Matlab, even Excel)
  - BIG/FAST computers
--

- R
  - Free and powerful
  - Relatively difficult, relatively recently 
  - Tidyverse package ~2016, currently supported by RStudio

--

&gt;"The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."

- What does it look like?

###Quantitative 
- Continuous (consistent intervals)
- Integer
- Real

.center[_** Which of these is your data? **_]

???
- Nominal - think job names or gender
- ordinal - think scales on a survey (Happy, Not happy)

- Quantitative - difference between 1 and 2 the same as 4 and 5

- typically, all of them at some time

---
class: center, middle

## At some point in the research process, "data" becomes a list of numbers

--

## This list is often very long!

--

  FYI - No one wants to see your list :(

--

## So how do you talk about your data with others?

???
In this class - flat files that have been "tidied"

## Words

&gt; "Overall, 216 tasks (28.2%) contained self talk. Twelve of the sixteen participants, seven younger and five older adults, engaged in self talk at some point in the session. The average rates of self talk for younger and older adults were not significantly different (25.9% and 32.1%, respectively) by Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, z &lt; 1, N.S. As found in study one and illustrated in Figure 4, there were large individual differences in participantsâ€™ rate of self talk for both younger adults and elder adults."  

???

- Point out the "stats"
- Description of the data
- Talk about categorical as ## and mean as as central tendency

---
# Descriptive statistics - summarizing quantitative data

Measures of location or central tendency
- In general, in what region is the list located on the number line?
- What number is typical of the entire list?
- What number is in the center of the list?

--

Measures of spread or variability
- How far is the list spread out over the number line?

--

Measures of shape
- Pattern of relative interval sizes, moving from left to right

???
- Measures used differ based on field and the nature of the data
- Tend to treat the "normal dist" as the basis

# The sample median


- Order the numbers from highest to lowest
- If number of numbers is odd, choose the middle
- If number of numbers is even, choose the average of the 2 middle values


```r
median(x)
```

# The sample mean

The arithmetic mean of the data

`$$\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nx_i$$`

where `\(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n\)` represent the `\(n\)` observed values.

--

- Number with the smallest sum of *squared* distances to the list of numbers

--

- Hence, the mean is a *least squares estimator*

--

Unless ALL scores are identical, most if not all, scores will be different from the mean.

???
There are other ways of calculating the mean - see refs

# Skewness

Skewness statistics provide information about departures from symmetry

--

Draws on all 3 measures of location

--

The standard definition of skewness in a population is the average cubed z-score

--

![](01-images/skew.png)

???
- The terms for skewness appear to be reversed for some people (due to "weightiness")
- Think of "pulling? in the direction of the skew term
---


# Calculating skewness

Here is one way to calculate skewness, using the formula for the adjusted Fisher-Pearson standardized moment coefficient, `\(G_1\)`:

`$$G_1 = \frac{n}{(n-1)(n-2)}\sum_{i=1}^n {\frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^3}{s^3}}$$`



```r
g1_calculate &lt;- function(x = data){
  s3.x &lt;- sum((x-mean(x))^3/sd(x)^3) # right side of eq
  n &lt;- length(x)
  g1 &lt;- (n/((n-1)*(n-2)))*s3.x
  return(g1)
}

g1_calculate(x)
```

```
## [1] 1.101962
```

```r
g1_calculate(scale(x)) #scale is one way to create a z-score
```

```
## [1] 1.101962
```

.center[**_?? If the data have high skewness (due to a "long" tail), what does that say about the sample mean and variance/sd ??_**]

???

- Look at just the x's distance from mean. Since they're cubed, the distances from mean retain their sign. Thus if one tail is "long" it will pull the skewness calc in that direction.

- High skewness implies

# Calculating skewness in R

```r
# install.packages("moments")
library(moments)
skewness(x)
```

```
## [1] 0.7392188
```

```r
skewness(scale(x))
```

```
## [1] 0.7392188
```


---

# Kurtosis

`$$K = n*\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n{(x_i - \bar{x})^4}} {(\sum_{i=1}^n{(x_i - \bar{x})^2)^2}}$$`


- The basic idea of kurtosis is that it is the average 4th power of the z-scores
Kurtosis of a distribution is typically expressed relative to that of a normal distribution.

--

- The normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3. So, the most common measure of kurtosis is the average 4th power of the z-scores minus 3.

--

- This can be computed in a number of ways. The simplest version is biased for a normal distribution, but is reported by some programs.

--

.center[**_?? If the data have high kurtosis (due to "heavy" tails), what does that say about the sample mean and variance/sd ??_**]

???

A little harder to see what's happening. Here the 4th power removes the signs, but adds great weight to data in the tails. Thus if the tails have a lot of data, the kurtosis will be large.

---

# Calculating kurtosis


```r
#1)
s4.x &lt;- sum((x-mean(x))^4) #using raw
s2.x &lt;- sum((x-mean(x))^2) #using raw
n &lt;- length(x)
n*s4.x/s2.x^2
```

```
## [1] 2.348269

```r
#2) 
z.x &lt;- (x - mean(x))/sd(x) #makes z-scores using x
s4.z &lt;- sum((z.x-mean(z.x))^4) #using z
s2.z &lt;- sum((z.x-mean(z.x))^2) #using z
n*s4.z/s2.z^2

#Some intuitions about stats

To the board!

- Confidence Intervals

- Linear Modeling

- Comparing samples

???

CI - but your mean isn't special. What would happen if I sampled a bunch?

Linear Modeling
  - whats a good model
    - indedendent vars (more? less? 2 have same effect)
    - fit (sloped, flat, close, messy)

Comparing
  - need the same shape, thus why we worry about transformations
  - Most of what we'll do is based on the glm
  - z-test. t-test. anova, chi-square
