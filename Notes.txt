Notes for next time...

Create a map of what is covered where. think about what needs to be in class vs out...

Look at the plots in ncp_plus.Rmd

CM042 was way too short. Perhaps lecture longer/more on classic methods? (see below)

The slides for 2017 Class 12 should be better incorporated into CM 4.2 or 4.4 - In general, confidence intervals deserve more attention in a cohesive manner.

CM044 was almost too long. And definitely would be with the new CI/RoR slides I added after the fact. Perhaps focus it more on NHST (z and t) and do CIs separately?

CM045 - need to add pre-class readings - use the ones from the reference page.

CM046 - Now doing a & b. a) GLM and t-tests. b) Anova
  There were some good slides on ncp that "could" be incorporated into cm045, however, one is ppt and one Rmd. I've saved the Rmd as ncp_plus.Rmd. 

The Transforms from the first class didn't really "stick". Maybe do them when we get to dists?

The sneetches in-class lab needs "insight" questions added.

Too much content is now too late - squish Probability and/or RVs?

Midterm - fix problems 
  Free: 3g-make it a CI, 5- should be harder: Mult: replace 5(a or e), fix 18 to include the correct answer, and make 30 an infer (or less obtuse)
  
CM054 - add more about contrasts (from slide deck 15?) and using the contrast matrix to compare across factors
